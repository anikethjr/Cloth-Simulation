# Cloth Simulation using Spring Mass Model and Internal Energy Model

Each model is located in a separate folder.

Steps to get the code running:

1. Install OpenGL, GLUT and GLM.

2. Clone the repo.

3. Compile each model using the command "g++-5 *.cpp *.h -std=c++11 -lGL -lglut -lGLU"

4. Run the executables. Use the WASDRF to move the camera and the IJKLZX keys to rotate the camera and look around.

Refer to the HTML documentation in the 'documentation' folder to learn more about the project. Code documentation generated using doxygen can be found in 'html' folders of the individual models.
